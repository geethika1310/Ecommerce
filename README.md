# E-Commerce Data Analysis Project

## 📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and managing data for an e-commerce platform. The objective is to build insights into customer behavior, product performance, and operational efficiency. The project uses SQL for data handling, Python (via Jupyter Notebook) for ETL processes, and various datasets to generate actionable insights.

---

## 🛠️ Features and Highlights
- **SQL Scripting**: Comprehensive SQL queries for data creation, insertion, validation, and integrity checks.
- **ETL Pipeline**: A Jupyter Notebook for extracting, transforming, and loading data into analytical workflows.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**:
  - Customer Lifetime Value Analysis
  - Product Inventory Reports
- **Datasets**: Realistic datasets covering orders, payments, products, reviews, and users.
- **Reports**: Final outputs to guide strategic decision-making.

### ETL Pipeline - Key Component of the Project 🚀

#### **Overview**
The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline is a critical part of this project. It processes raw e-commerce data into clean, structured formats, ready for analysis. The ETL pipeline is implemented in Python within the `ETL_ECommerce_Project.ipynb` notebook.

---

#### **Modules and Process**
1. **Extract**:
   - Data is sourced from multiple files, including:
     - CSV files: `orders_data.csv`, `products_data.csv`, `users_data.csv`
     - Excel files: `payments_data.xlsx`, `reviews_data.xlsx`
   - Libraries Used: `pandas`, `openpyxl`

2. **Transform**:
   - **Data Cleaning**: 
     - Handled missing values, duplicate entries, and inconsistent formats.
   - **Data Enrichment**:
     - Added calculated fields such as total payment amounts, product ratings averages, etc.
   - **Normalization**:
     - Ensured data is structured for relational database compatibility.
   - Libraries Used: `pandas`, `numpy`

3. **Load**:
   - Transformed data is loaded into a structured database using SQL scripts or stored as processed CSVs for analysis.
   - Integration with `sqlite3` or any preferred database can be configured.
   - Libraries Used: `sqlalchemy`, `sqlite3`

---

#### **What We've Done**
- Unified raw datasets from multiple sources into a cohesive structure.
- Automated cleaning processes to handle thousands of data points efficiently.
- Generated a dataset ready for SQL analysis and KPI computations.
- Documented all steps in a clear and reproducible notebook for transparency and scalability.

---

This ETL process is designed for flexibility and adaptability, making it a robust framework for handling e-commerce data workflows!

---

## 🚀 What We Accomplished
- **Database Management**: Created and maintained normalized databases using SQL.
- **ETL Processes**: Automated the transformation and loading of datasets for analysis.
- **Insights Generation**:
  - Customer Lifetime Value report to understand customer profitability.
  - Product Inventory report to track inventory performance.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensured high data quality through validation scripts.

---

## 🔍 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/E-Commerce-Data-Analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd E-Commerce-Data-Analysis
   ```
3. Set up a database using the provided SQL scripts.
4. Run the ETL process using `ETL_ECommerce_Project.ipynb`.
5. Analyze the final reports in the `Reports/` folder.

---

## 📊 Example Use Cases
1. **Customer Insights**:
   - Identify high-value customers and tailor marketing strategies.
2. **Inventory Management**:
   - Streamline product restocking based on inventory trends.
3. **Data Quality**:
   - Use validation scripts to ensure consistency and reliability of datasets.
